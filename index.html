</picture><p>Some performers never make a bigger splash than with their first record, a situation that the Ramones and De La Soul know all too well. If that's the case, though, said musicians had better make sure that debut is a doozy. Aztec Camera, or more specifically,
    Roddy Frame, falls squarely into this scenario, because while he has doggedly plugged away ever since with a series of what are, at times, not bad releases, High Land, Hard Rain remains the lovely touchstone of Frame's career. Very much the contemporaries
    of such well-scrubbed Scottish guitar pop confectionaries as Orange Juice, but with the best gumption and star quality of them all, Aztec Camera led off the album with "Oblivious," a mini-masterpiece of acoustic guitar hooks, lightly funky rhythms,
    and swooning backing vocals. If nothing tops that on High Land, Hard Rain, most of the remaining songs come very close, while they also carefully avoid coming across like a series of general sound-alikes. Frame's wry way around words of love (as well
    as his slightly nasal singing) drew comparisons to Elvis Costello, but Frame sounds far less burdened by expectations and more freely fun. References from Keats to Joe Strummer crop up (not to mention an inspired steal from Iggy's "Lust for Life"
    on "Queen's Tattoos"), but never overwhelm Frame's ruminations on romance, which are both sweet and sour. Musically, his capable band backs him with gusto, from the solo-into-full-band showstopper "The Bugle Sounds Again" to the heart-stopping guitar
    work on "Lost Outside the Tunnel." Whether listeners want to investigate further from here is up to them, but High Land, Hard Rain itself is a flat-out must-have.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="39"><!-- react-empty: 40 --></div></section><section id="section-h_GraphicalColumn-1588d1e3-5636-4157-949c-b93fd015dfcd" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-center group-order-normal  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="41"><div class="Component ms-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="42"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ms-w-50p" data-reactid="43"><span class="" data-reactid="44"><div class="Cover ov-h " data-reactid="45"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="46"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a09b8bc2c721b1e4d491026921cccee2/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdf034c30-1f58-4bb8-b36f-c147d36df832.png&amp;width=713" style="object-position:22.159887798036465% 12.79887482419128%;" data-reactid="47"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a09b8bc2c721b1e4d491026921cccee2/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdf034c30-1f58-4bb8-b36f-c147d36df832.png&amp;width=713" style="object-position:22.159887798036465% 12.79887482419128%;" data-reactid="48"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a09b8bc2c721b1e4d491026921cccee2/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdf034c30-1f58-4bb8-b36f-c147d36df832.png&amp;width=713" style="object-position:22.159887798036465% 12.79887482419128%;" data-reactid="49"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9eed5168d23cf6c1a58a7da51c83c6c9/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdf034c30-1f58-4bb8-b36f-c147d36df832.png&amp;width=360" style="object-position:22.159887798036465% 12.79887482419128%;" data-reactid="50"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="713" data-height="711" data-ratio="1.0028129395218002" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a09b8bc2c721b1e4d491026921cccee2/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdf034c30-1f58-4bb8-b36f-c147d36df832.png&amp;width=713" style="object-position:22.159887798036465% 12.79887482419128%;" data-reactid="51"/></picture></div></span></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="52"><!-- react-empty: 53 --><!-- react-empty: 54 --><!-- react-empty: 55 --><!-- react-empty: 56 --><!-- react-empty: 57 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="58"><p>Recorded after singer/songwriter Mark Linkous' accidental, near-fatal drug reaction and subsequent 12-week stay in London's St. Mary's Hospital, Good Morning Spider dwells in the gray areas between dreaming and waking, sickness and health, and living and dying. The album takes these grey areas and makes a world out of them, blending classic songwriting with an experimental sound that borrows from hi-fi and lo-fi. It's a natural progression from their debut, Vivadixiesubmarine transmissionplot, which introduced Sparklehorse's refreshing mix of classic songwriting and sonic experimentation. Good Morning Spider adds bubbling synths, ambient electronics, horns and drum loops to the mix, giving songs like "Painbirds" an unclassifiable -- but distinctively Sparklehorse -- blend of darkness and childlike innocence. From driving, punky songs like "Pig" and "Cruel Sun," to frail, winding ballads such as "Saint Mary" and "Come On In," to the experimental pop of "Ghost of His Smile" and "Sunshine," the album encompasses a rainbow of sounds and emotions but never loses focus.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-f0c9674f-b1b8-4296-9f58-7298fc27eb10" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="59"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="60"><picture>

</picture><p>In one regard, Queen II does indeed provide more of the same thing as on the band's debut. Certainly, of all the other albums in Queen's catalog it bears the closest resemblance to its immediate predecessor, particularly in its lean, hard attack and in
    how it has only one song that is well-known to listeners outside of their hardcore cult: in this case, it's "Seven Seas of Rhye," which is itself more elliptical than "Keep Yourself Alive," the big song from the debut. But these similarities are superficial
    and Queen II is a very different beast than its predecessor, an album that is richer, darker, and weirder, an album that finds Queen growing as a band by leaps and bounds. There is still a surplus of ideas, but their energies are better focused this
    time around, channeled into a over-inflated, pompous rock that could be called prog if it wasn't so heavy. Even with all the queens and ogres that populate Queen II, this never feels as fantastical as Genesis or Uriah Heep, and that's because Queen
    hits hard as a rock band here, where even the blasts of vocal harmonies feel like power chords, no matter how florid they are. Besides, these grandiose harmonies, along with the handful of wistful ballads here, are overshadowed by the onslaught of
    guitars and pummeling rhythms that give Queen II majesty and menace. Queen is coiled, tense, and vicious here, delivering on their inherent sense of drama, and that gives Queen II real power as music, as well as a true cohesion. The one thing that
    is missing is any semblance of a pop sensibility, even when they flirt with a mock Phil Spector production on "Funny How Love Is." This hits like heavy metal but has an art-rock sensibility through and through, which also means that it has no true
    hook in for those who don't want to succumb to Queen's world. But that kind of insular drama is quite alluring in its own right, which is why Queen II is one of the favorites of their hardcore fans. At the very least, it illustrates that Queen is
    starting to pull all their ambitions and influences into a signature sound, and it's quite powerful in that regard.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="61"><!-- react-empty:

surprising and daring as ever -- exchanging the volcanic noise and twisted sensibilities of earlier releases for ornate arrangements and ethereal strings, Deserter's Songs unlocks the beauty always hidden just below the band's surface, its lush harmonics and soothing textures bathing in an almost unearthly light. Standouts including the exquisitely waltz-like "Tonite It Shows" and the celestial "Endlessly" are like lullabies, their music-box melodies gentle and narcotic; even the most pop-oriented moments like "Opus 40" and "Hudson Line" share a symphonic, candy-colored majesty far removed from conventional rock idioms. Complete with its fractured instrumental interludes and odd effects, Deserter's Songs sounds like no other album -- for that matter, it doesn't even sound like Mercury Rev, yet there's no mistaking the record's brilliance for anyone else.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-55948958-3de2-4dcf-a892-4af134c79137" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="90"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="91"><picture>

</picture><p>While in appearance, it seems like a sequel to Liberation -- a similar cover shot down to the typeface that is on the front, in this case showing Hannon in front of the IM Pei-designed entrance to the Louvre, while the back shows a similarly Rococo piece
    of decoration -- Promenade is in fact even more extremely and defiantly non-rock than its predecessor. With a larger number of string performers to accompany him, not to mention someone on oboe, sax, and cor anglais (English horn), Hannon retains
    only drummer/co-producer Darren Allison from the previous record to make what remains his most self-conscious art release to date. The opening "Bath" sets the course, with seacoast sounds and a brief spoken word bit that turns into a minimalist Michael
    Nyman homage before slamming into the song proper, where the guitars and bass take a back seat to the choir, strings, and woodwinds, all the while driven along by Allison's solid percussion. From there all kinds of twists and turns emerge in an alternate
    universe where classical instrumentation offers as much pop as a guitar strum. The extreme archness of "Going Downhill Fast" is also a pub singalong, while "Don't Look Down" builds to a dramatic, striking ending. Hannon's wickedly sharp wit informs
    almost everything; "The Booklovers" is the clear winner on that count, as Hannon tremulously recites a number of authors' names (with an appropriate accompanying sample or aside, often quite hilarious) over a stately arrangement. "A Seafood Song"
    and "A Drinking Song" celebrate exactly what they say they do, the latter offering up the great line "All my lovers will be pink and elephantine!" At the same time, the tender side of Hannon, which has sometimes been ignored, surfaces more than once,
    with "The Summerhouse," a nostalgic, wonderfully gentle piece on a lost season of love. This turns out to be one of Hannon's best songs ever.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="92"><!-- react-empty: 93 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-155c6cd6-5605-4ea7-8de7-f59e47fa0120" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="94"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="95"><picture>

</picture><p>The gold standard of the early-'90s power pop revival, in its own way Bandwagoneque was as much a benchmark as contemporary records like Nevermind and Loveless; though not the generational rallying cry of the former nor the revolutionary sonic breakthrough
    of the latter, Teenage Fanclub's sophomore album nevertheless heralded the return of melody and craft, coupled with energy and spirit -- hallmarks of much of the greatest rock &amp; roll of the past, and virtues as rare as hen's teeth in the years
    immediately prior to the disc's release. Although its incandescent harmonies, lazily immediate songs, and crunching guitars earned it endless comparisons to vintage Big Star, Bandwagonesque is in every way a product of its own time -- the thick, grungy
    sound of the Fannies' debut A Catholic Education remains intact for gems like "What You Do to Me" (arguably the most brilliantly simpleminded love song ever penned) and the instrumental "Satan," while the lyrics of other standout moments like "Star
    Sign" and "Alcoholiday" reflect a laissez faire irony and unassuming genius even more emblematic of the moment in question.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="96"><!-- react-empty: 97 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-16425c84-752d-4a62-8885-e3f180ed73a3" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="98"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="99"><picture>

</picture><p>In Rainbows, as a title, implies a sense of comfort and delightfulness. Symbolically, rainbows are more likely to be associated with kittens and warm blankets than the grim and glum circumstances Radiohead is known for soundtracking. There's a slight,
    if expected, twist at play. The band is more than familiar with the unpleasant moods associated with colors like red, green, and blue -- all of which, of course, are colors within a rainbow -- all of which are present, and even mentioned, during the
    album. On a couple levels, then, In Rainbows is not any less fitting as a Radiohead album title than "Myxomatosis" is as a Radiohead song title. Despite references to "going off the rails," hitting "the bottom," getting "picked over by the worms,"
    being "dead from the neck up," and feeling "trapped" (twice), along with Radiohead Wordplay Deluxe Home Edition pieces like "comatose" and "nightmare" -- in the same song! double score! -- the one aspect of the album that becomes increasingly perceptible
    with each listen is how romantic it feels, albeit in the way that one might find the bioport scenes in David Cronenberg's eXistenZ to be extremely hot and somewhat unsettling. Surprisingly, some of the album's lyrics are even more personal/universal
    and straightforward than anything on The Eraser, the album made by Thom Yorke and Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich. "I'm an animal trapped in your hot car," from "All I Need," has to be one of the saddest, most open-hearted metaphors used to express
    unrequited love. "House of Cards" begins with "I don't want to be your friend/I just want to be your lover/No matter how it ends/No matter how it starts," and the one with the worms includes "I'd be crazy not to follow/Follow where you lead/Your eyes/They
    turn me." This effective weaving of disparate elements -- lyrical expressions commonly associated with the band, mixed in with ones suited for everyday love ballads -- goes for the music as well. The album is very song-oriented, with each track constantly
    moving forward and developing, yet there are abstract electronic layers and studio-as-instrument elements to prevent it from sounding like a regression.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="100"><!-- react-empty: 101 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-be9c9313-e718-4191-b873-34320f8b7c78" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="102"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="103"><picture>

</picture><p>Midlake's second album is a departure from their lo-fi, psychedelic pop-influenced debut. The Trials of Van Occupanther jumps with both feet into the '70s of Laurel Canyon troubadours and soft rock balladeers. It jumps like Bob Beamon right past any other
    current bands treading similar ground and jumps back into time, becoming one of the best examples of the sound and style you'll ever hear, date of release notwithstanding. The first thing you notice on the album is the stunning vocal harmonies; you
    might think you dropped in an America disc by mistake. (The best record America ever did, that is.) Tim Smith has the kind of voice you know could be a glass-shattering instrument on par with that of Buckley or Wainwright, but he keeps it dialed down
    to an intimate scale, which is a wise decision. His vocals bleed melancholy honesty, and the way it combines with Eric Pulido's voice will raise goose bumps. The arrangements provide a perfect bed for the vocals, with cottony layers of acoustic guitars
    and strings, gentle horns, restrained drums, and lyrical piano combining beautifully. The occasional surprises are effective, especially when they use some of the corniest synth sounds heard since Jan Hammer unstrapped his keytar for the last time,
    on "We Gathered in Spring" and "It Covers the Hillside." All of which is nice but isn't worth much without songs. Fortunately, Midlake writes unerringly tuneful melodies and thoughtful lyrics about topics other than love and introspection, and lays
    down plenty of gentle hooks. Nothing that you'll be singing in the shower for days at a time, but each song goes down smoothly and they add up to make The Trials of Van Occupanther a very pleasant, maybe even exciting in a restrained way, listening
    experience. You'll certainly find yourself reaching for it more often than you might expect; indeed, it has lasting power that many records that sound so good on first listen lack. Midlake might be stuck in the '70s, but they make it sound like the
    best place on earth.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="104"><!-- react-empty: 105 --></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="106"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="107"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="108"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="109"><span data-reactid="110"><!-- react-empty: 111 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="112"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="113">muzik</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="114"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="115"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="116"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

The album takes these grey areas and makes a world out of them, blending classic songwriting with an experimental sound that borrows from hi-fi and lo-fi.

The Trials of Van Occupanther jumps with both feet into the '70s of Laurel Canyon troubadours and soft rock balladeers. It jumps like Bob Beamon right past any other current bands treading similar ground and jumps back into time, becoming one of the best examples of the sound and style you'll ever hear, date of release notwithstanding. The first thing you notice on the album is the stunning vocal harmonies; you might think you dropped in an America disc by mistake. (The best record America ever did, that is.) Tim Smith has the kind of voice you know could be a glass-shattering instrument on par with that of Buckley or Wainwright, but he keeps it dialed down to an intimate scale, which is a wise decision. His vocals bleed melancholy honesty, and the way it combines with Eric Pulido's voice will raise goose bumps. The arrangements provide a perfect bed for the vocals, with cottony layers of acoustic guitars and strings, gentle horns, restrained drums, and lyrical piano combining beautifully. The occasional surprises are effective, especially when they use some of the corniest synth sounds heard since Jan Hammer unstrapped his keytar for the last time, on \"We Gathered in Spring\" and \"It Covers the Hillside.\" All of which is nice but isn't worth much without songs. Fortunately, Midlake writes unerringly tuneful melodies and thoughtful lyrics about topics other than love and introspection, and lays down plenty of gentle hooks. Nothing that you'll be singing in the shower for days at a time, but each song goes down smoothly and they add up to make The Trials of Van Occupanther a very pleasant, maybe even exciting in a restrained way, listening experience. You'll certainly find yourself reaching for it more often than you might expect; indeed, it has lasting power that many records that sound so good on first listen lack. Midlake might be stuck in the '70s, but they make it sound like the best place on earth.","keywords":[],"via":{}},"content":[{"id":"44ff797b-5861-437e-8891-5f41c795744d","item":"be9c9313-e718-4191-b873-34320f8b7c78","type":"image","created_at":"2016-08-01T08:45:00.985Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T08:45:03.625Z","_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5bb4db1a278a9c328b5895b8abee4215/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png&width=623\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5bb4db1a278a9c328b5895b8abee4215/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png&width=623\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5bb4db1a278a9c328b5895b8abee4215/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png&width=623\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/98e8ec36feb544090299a798518039a5/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5bb4db1a278a9c328b5895b8abee4215/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png&width=623\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[],"coverPrefs":{"filter":false,"crop":false,"overlay":false}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5bb4db1a278a9c328b5895b8abee4215/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png&width=623","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png","ratio":"623:625","aspect":0.9968,"orientation":"portrait","width":623,"height":625,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5bb4db1a278a9c328b5895b8abee4215/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png&width=623"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5bb4db1a278a9c328b5895b8abee4215/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png&width=623"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5bb4db1a278a9c328b5895b8abee4215/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png&width=623"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/98e8ec36feb544090299a798518039a5/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ffdf6b113-412e-43d4-9f33-2dc8d2ce4975.png&width=360"}],"colors":[[235,220,187],[30,25,21],[90,72,58],[140,122,108],[193,173,113]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[120,138],[513,624]],"confidence":0.145187,"center":[348,380],"radius":278.228},"exif":{}}},{"id":"c1acea69-b007-47a5-906b-e4120e85ea43","item":"be9c9313-e718-4191-b873-34320f8b7c78","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-01T08:45:03.625Z","updated_at":null,"_text":"Midlake's second album is a departure from their lo-fi, psychedelic pop-influenced debut. The Trials of Van Occupanther jumps with both feet into the '70s of Laurel Canyon troubadours and soft rock balladeers.

The first thing you notice on the album is the stunning vocal harmonies; you might think you dropped in an America disc by mistake. (The best record America ever did, that is.) Tim Smith has the kind of voice you know could be a glass-shattering instrument on par with that of Buckley or Wainwright, but he keeps it dialed down to an intimate scale, which is a wise decision. His vocals bleed melancholy honesty, and the way it combines with Eric Pulido's voice will raise goose bumps. The arrangements provide a perfect bed for the vocals, with cottony layers of acoustic guitars and strings, gentle horns, restrained drums, and lyrical piano combining beautifully. The occasional surprises are effective, especially when they use some of the corniest synth sounds heard since Jan Hammer unstrapped his keytar for the last time, on \"We Gathered in Spring\" and \"It Covers the Hillside.\" All of which is nice but isn't worth much without songs. Fortunately, Midlake writes unerringly tuneful melodies and thoughtful lyrics about topics other than love and introspection, and lays down plenty of gentle hooks.
