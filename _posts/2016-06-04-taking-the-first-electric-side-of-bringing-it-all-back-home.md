  Taking the first, electric side of Bringing It All Back Home to its logical
  conclusion, Bob Dylan hired a full rock & roll band, featuring guitarist
  Michael Bloomfield, for Highway 61 Revisited. Opening with the epic "Like a
  Rolling Stone," Highway 61 Revisited careens through nine songs that range
  from reflective folk-rock ("Desolation Row") and blues ("It Takes a Lot to
  Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry") to flat-out garage rock ("Tombstone Blues,"
  "From a Buick 6," "Highway 61 Revisited"). Dylan had not only changed his
  sound, but his persona, trading the folk troubadour for a streetwise, cynical
  hipster. Throughout the album, he embraces druggy, surreal imagery, which can
  either have a sense of menace or beauty, and the music reflects that, jumping
  between soothing melodies to hard, bluesy rock. And that is the most
  revolutionary thing about Highway 61 Revisited -- it proved that rock & roll
  needn't be collegiate and tame in order to be literate, poetic, and complex.

The recording sessions for the Byrds' fifth album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers, were conducted in the midst of internal turmoil that found them reduced to a duo by the time the record was completed. That wasn't evident from listening to the results, which showed the group continuing to expand the parameters of their eclecticism while retaining their hallmark guitar jangle and harmonies. With assistance from producer Gary Usher, they took more chances in the studio, enhancing the spacy quality of tracks like "Natural Harmony" and Goffin & King's "Wasn't Born to Follow" with electronic phasing. Washes of Moog synthesizer formed the eerie backdrop for "Space Odyssey," and the songs were craftily and unobtrusively linked with segues and fades. But the Byrds did not bury the essential strengths of their tunes in effects: "Goin' Back" (also written by Goffin & King) was a magnificent and melodic cover with the expected tasteful 12-string guitar runs that should have been a big hit. "Tribal Gathering" has some of the band's most effervescent harmonies; "Draft Morning" is a subtle and effective reflection of the horrors of the Vietnam War; and "Old John Robertson" looks forward to the country-rock that would soon dominate their repertoire.
