  In one regard, Queen II does indeed provide more of the same thing as on the
  band's debut. Certainly, of all the other albums in Queen's catalog it bears
  the closest resemblance to its immediate predecessor, particularly in its
  lean, hard attack and in how it has only one song that is well-known to
  listeners outside of their hardcore cult: in this case, it's "Seven Seas of
  Rhye," which is itself more elliptical than "Keep Yourself Alive," the big
  song from the debut. But these similarities are superficial and Queen II is a
  very different beast than its predecessor, an album that is richer, darker,
  and weirder, an album that finds Queen growing as a band by leaps and bounds.
  There is still a surplus of ideas, but their energies are better focused this
  time around, channeled into a over-inflated, pompous rock that could be called
  prog if it wasn't so heavy. Even with all the queens and ogres that populate
  Queen II, this never feels as fantastical as Genesis or Uriah Heep, and that's
  because Queen hits hard as a rock band here, where even the blasts of vocal
  harmonies feel like power chords, no matter how florid they are. Besides,
  these grandiose harmonies, along with the handful of wistful ballads here, are
  overshadowed by the onslaught of guitars and pummeling rhythms that give Queen
  II majesty and menace. Queen is coiled, tense, and vicious here, delivering on
  their inherent sense of drama, and that gives Queen II real power as music, as
  well as a true cohesion. The one thing that is missing is any semblance of a
  pop sensibility, even when they flirt with a mock Phil Spector production on
  "Funny How Love Is." This hits like heavy metal but has an art-rock
  sensibility through and through, which also means that it has no true hook in
  for those who don't want to succumb to Queen's world. But that kind of insular
  drama is quite alluring in its own right, which is why Queen II is one of the
  favorites of their hardcore fans. At the very least, it illustrates that Queen
  is starting to pull all their ambitions and influences into a signature sound,
  and it's quite powerful in that regard.
