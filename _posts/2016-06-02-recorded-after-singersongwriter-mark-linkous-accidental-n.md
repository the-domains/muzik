description: "Recorded after singer/songwriter Mark Linkous' accidental, near-fatal drug reaction and subsequent 12-week stay in London's St. Mary's Hospital, Good Morning Spider dwells in the gray areas between dreaming and waking, sickness and health, and living and dying. The album takes these grey areas and makes a world out of them, blending classic songwriting with an experimental sound that borrows from hi-fi and lo-fi. It's a natural progression from their debut, Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot, which introduced Sparklehorse's refreshing mix of classic songwriting and sonic experimentation. Good Morning Spider adds bubbling synths, ambient electronics, horns and drum loops to the mix, giving songs like \"Painbirds\" an unclassifiable -- but distinctively Sparklehorse -- blend of darkness and childlike innocence. From driving, punky songs like \"Pig\" and \"Cruel Sun,\" to frail, winding ballads such as \"Saint Mary\" and \"Come On In,\" to the experimental pop of \"Ghost of His Smile\" and \"Sunshine,\" the album encompasses a rainbow of sounds and emotions but never loses focus."

Recorded after singer/songwriter Mark Linkous' accidental, near-fatal drug reaction and subsequent 12-week stay in London's St. Mary's Hospital, Good Morning Spider dwells in the gray areas between dreaming and waking, sickness and health, and living and dying. The album takes these grey areas and makes a world out of them, blending classic songwriting with an experimental sound that borrows from hi-fi and lo-fi. It's a natural progression from their debut, Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot, which introduced Sparklehorse's refreshing mix of classic songwriting and sonic experimentation. Good Morning Spider adds bubbling synths, ambient electronics, horns and drum loops to the mix, giving songs like "Painbirds" an unclassifiable -- but distinctively Sparklehorse -- blend of darkness and childlike innocence. From driving, punky songs like "Pig" and "Cruel Sun," to frail, winding ballads such as "Saint Mary" and "Come On In," to the experimental pop of "Ghost of His Smile" and "Sunshine," the album encompasses a rainbow of sounds and emotions but never loses focus.
