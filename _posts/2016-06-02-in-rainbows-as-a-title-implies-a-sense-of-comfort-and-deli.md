  In Rainbows, as a title, implies a sense of comfort and delightfulness.
  Symbolically, rainbows are more likely to be associated with kittens and warm
  blankets than the grim and glum circumstances Radiohead is known for
  soundtracking. There's a slight, if expected, twist at play. The band is more
  than familiar with the unpleasant moods associated with colors like red,
  green, and blue -- all of which, of course, are colors within a rainbow -- all
  of which are present, and even mentioned, during the album. On a couple
  levels, then, In Rainbows is not any less fitting as a Radiohead album title
  than "Myxomatosis" is as a Radiohead song title. Despite references to "going
  off the rails," hitting "the bottom," getting "picked over by the worms,"
  being "dead from the neck up," and feeling "trapped" (twice), along with
  Radiohead Wordplay Deluxe Home Edition pieces like "comatose" and "nightmare"
  -- in the same song! double score! -- the one aspect of the album that becomes
  increasingly perceptible with each listen is how romantic it feels, albeit in
  the way that one might find the bioport scenes in David Cronenberg's eXistenZ
  to be extremely hot and somewhat unsettling. Surprisingly, some of the album's
  lyrics are even more personal/universal and straightforward than anything on
  The Eraser, the album made by Thom Yorke and Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich.
  "I'm an animal trapped in your hot car," from "All I Need," has to be one of
  the saddest, most open-hearted metaphors used to express unrequited love.
  "House of Cards" begins with "I don't want to be your friend/I just want to be
  your lover/No matter how it ends/No matter how it starts," and the one with
  the worms includes "I'd be crazy not to follow/Follow where you lead/Your
  eyes/They turn me." This effective weaving of disparate elements -- lyrical
  expressions commonly associated with the band, mixed in with ones suited for
  everyday love ballads -- goes for the music as well. The album is very
  song-oriented, with each track constantly moving forward and developing, yet
  there are abstract electronic layers and studio-as-instrument elements to
  prevent it from sounding like a regression.
