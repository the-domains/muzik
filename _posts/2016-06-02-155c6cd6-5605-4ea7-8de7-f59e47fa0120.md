  The gold standard of the early-'90s power pop revival, in its own way
  Bandwagoneque was as much a benchmark as contemporary records like Nevermind
  and Loveless; though not the generational rallying cry of the former nor the
  revolutionary sonic breakthrough of the latter, Teenage Fanclub's sophomore
  album nevertheless heralded the return of melody and craft, coupled with
  energy and spirit -- hallmarks of much of the greatest rock & roll of the
  past, and virtues as rare as hen's teeth in the years immediately prior to the
  disc's release. Although its incandescent harmonies, lazily immediate songs,
  and crunching guitars earned it endless comparisons to vintage Big Star,
  Bandwagonesque is in every way a product of its own time -- the thick, grungy
  sound of the Fannies' debut A Catholic Education remains intact for gems like
  "What You Do to Me" (arguably the most brilliantly simpleminded love song ever
  penned) and the instrumental "Satan," while the lyrics of other standout
  moments like "Star Sign" and "Alcoholiday" reflect a laissez faire irony and
  unassuming genius even more emblematic of the moment in question.
