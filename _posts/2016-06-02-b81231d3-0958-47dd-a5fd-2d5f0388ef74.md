  Four albums in and Mercury Rev remain as surprising and daring as ever --
  exchanging the volcanic noise and twisted sensibilities of earlier releases
  for ornate arrangements and ethereal strings, Deserter's Songs unlocks the
  beauty always hidden just below the band's surface, its lush harmonics and
  soothing textures bathing in an almost unearthly light. Standouts including
  the exquisitely waltz-like "Tonite It Shows" and the celestial "Endlessly" are
  like lullabies, their music-box melodies gentle and narcotic; even the most
  pop-oriented moments like "Opus 40" and "Hudson Line" share a symphonic,
  candy-colored majesty far removed from conventional rock idioms. Complete with
  its fractured instrumental interludes and odd effects, Deserter's Songs sounds
  like no other album -- for that matter, it doesn't even sound like Mercury
  Rev, yet there's no mistaking the record's brilliance for anyone else.
